# A Homebridge plugin for EPSON Projector #

Tested to work with EPSON HomeCinema 2150. It should work with any other EPSON projector with EPSON iProjection support.

To make your projector work with the plugin:

1. Connect your projector to your home network.

2. Write down the IP address of the projector.

3. Create your config file according to [`config-example.json`](config-example.json)

This plugin is still very experimental. Please create an issue or a pull request for any problem you encountered.
